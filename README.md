A simple High Low game that uses binary search
High-Low Number Guessing Game
This is a simple Python console game where the computer guesses the number you think of using the principles of binary search. The program guarantees to find your number in 10 guesses or fewer.

How It Works
Think of a number between 1 and 1000 (or any defined range).
The program will make a guess and ask if it should go higher (H), lower (L), or if it guessed correctly (C).
The game ends when the correct number is guessed or if you break the rules!
Features
Interactive and intuitive gameplay.
Displays an ASCII art splash screen at the start of the game.
Implements binary search to efficiently guess the number.
Friendly winning screen on a correct guess.
